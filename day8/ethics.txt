ETHICS MORALS AND LAW

Morals are just one's personal beliefs of right and wrong
Ethics refer to codes or standards of behaviour expected of a person by a group or organization to which they belong
Policy describes the outline of what a government/company intends to do and what it intends not to do as well as what it can achieve for society as a whole
The Law is a system of rules that tell us what we can do and what we cannot do. Policies lead to the enacting of laws by a nation
A moral claim evaluates the rightness or wrongness of an action or a person's character
Ethics is the philosophical study of morality, a rational examination into people's behavior and moral belief's
Ethics may also be defined as a set of moral values and principles that govern the conduct of a group or individual
Laws are rules that mandate or prohibit certain behaviour; they are drawn from ethics
Laws are the rules members of a society create to balance the individual rights to self determination against the needs of society
The key difference between Law and Ethics is that Law carries the authority of a governing body whereas ethics is based on a common fraternity
Policies are guidelines that dictate acceptable and unacceptable employee behaviour in the workplace
